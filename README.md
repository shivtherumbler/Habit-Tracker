A habit tracker reimagined through an interactive aquarium!

Project Overview
Fishly is a habit-tracking application that visualizes personal progress through an animated aquarium environment. 
Inspired by Tamagotchi-style virtual pets, Fishly transforms daily habits into interactive experiences! Each habit is represented by a unique fish, and it grows and thrives as the habit you chose is maintained. 
The app is designed to be both functional and give you a unique sense of ownership, turning behavioral tracking into something playful and emotionally engaging.

Technology Stack
UX and Design Strategy: Figma
Frontend: React Native, Bootstrap (for base styling)
Backend: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB
Authentication: Custom login system
Deployment-ready API: RESTful structure with complete CRUD support


Project Management
We followed an agile SCRUM methodology. 
Weekly stand-ups and task planning sessions were conducted to track progress and shift priorities as needed. We organized into 10 sprints over the course of development with notes saved on MS Teams.
Tools Used to Manage the Project:
Google Docs · Discord · GitHub · Asana · Microsoft Teams
Project Milestones:
Week 1: 
UX Research: Habit tracking behavior, gamification strategies.
Week 2: 
Wireframing: User flows, app structure, initial aquarium concepts were created.
Week 3: 
Visual Design: Mobile-first mockups, fish illustration styles, UI themes created on Figma.
Week 4: 
Backend Setup: MongoDB schema, Node API setup.
Week 5: 
CRUD Development: Insert, Update, Delete, Select operations.
Week 6: 
ZIM Integration Research: Learning canvas libraries, testing interactions.
Week 7: 
Pivot to React Native: Aquarium visuals rebuilt using native components.
Week 8: 
Feature Integration: Tying fish to habits, building analytics page.
Week 9: 
Admin Panel + Polish: Adding fish, fine-tuning UX, responsive layout.
Week 10: 
QA, Backend Issue Fixes & Final Presentation: Testing, bug fixes, prep work.

Core Features
User login and authentication
Full habit management (Add, View, Edit, Delete)
Fish tied to each habit and visually rendered in aquarium
Admin panel for adding custom fish
Analytics page showing user count, total habits, and trends
Mobile-first experience with real-time interaction

Breakthroughs and Stumbles
What Worked:
Backend was smooth and scalable from the start
React Native allowed clean animations and mobile support
Fish-habitat mapping added novelty to habit tracking
Clear division of tasks streamlined development
What Didn’t:
ZIM.js proved incompatible with React’s architecture
Canvas/DOM clashes caused delays and confusion
Animations were harder to control on web than on mobile
Node.js and express often ran into some issues when we tried to deploy it

Monetization Strategy
Fishly will follow a freemium model. This will include:
Free Tier

Habit History Export to PDF for power users
Referral Bonuses → encourage viral growth

Future Roadmap
Push to mobile app stores (iOS/Android)
Add daily habit reminders and gamified challenges
User avatars and friend aquariums
Habit streak insurance (mini-microtransaction model)
Mood-based fish behavior (tie-in with emotion logging)

Conclusion and Outcome
Fishly aims to be a unique habit-tracking experience! 
It combines backend reliability, interactive front-end design, and a strong UX vision. 
The app was completed successfully with great teamwork, effective time management, and a clear pivot when technical challenges arose.
